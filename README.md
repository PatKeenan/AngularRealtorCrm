# Real Estate Project Management
[This is a demo app](https://realtorcrm-b26c0.web.app/) that's still under construction.
This project was created for real estate agents who use several apps on a daily basis to manage their business. The goal is to get all the important parts of the business under one roof to simplify the day to day.

- Working as a Real Estate Agent for over a year now, I noticed a real lack of useful apps that can efficently speed up the day to day operations of a solo agent.
- Several agents use and pay for several sepearte apps that all do only one thing they need or are built for large companies and require someone with a tech background to set up.

### Technology Used
- Html
- Javascript
- Sass
- Bootstrap 5
- Angular

Deployed on Firebase.
